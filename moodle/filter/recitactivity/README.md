## Introduction

This filter allows, among other things, the display of the activity icon as well as a check mark indicating the status of a completed activity. It also allows you to take advantage of Moodle's database and create a more personalized experience. The examples below show you the available integration codes and the result on the user's screen.

The attached example shows the display of the student's name on a page. The left side shows the learner's screen. On the right side, we see the embedding code in the editor. The `[[d/user.firstname]]` parameter causes the student's first name to be displayed. The information is taken from the database.

## Testing

This is a filter plugin. The best way to test it is to find a HTML input and write a list of test shortcodes to test it. You can use the tiny_shortcode plugin to do this.
